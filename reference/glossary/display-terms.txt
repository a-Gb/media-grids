# Display Technology Glossary
# This file contains definitions of common display technology terms

# Term: Aspect Ratio
id: aspect-ratio
term: Aspect Ratio
definition: The proportional relationship between the width and height of a display or image, typically expressed as a ratio such as 16:9 or 4:3.
related_terms: resolution, display format
reference_standard: aspect-ratios
reference_id: common-ratios

# Term: Resolution
id: resolution
term: Resolution
definition: The number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed, typically expressed as width × height (e.g., 1920×1080).
related_terms: aspect ratio, pixel density, 4K, 8K
reference_standard: resolutions
reference_id: common-resolutions

# Term: Refresh Rate
id: refresh-rate
term: Refresh Rate
definition: The number of times per second that a display updates its buffer, measured in hertz (Hz). Higher refresh rates reduce motion blur and create smoother animations.
related_terms: frame rate, motion blur, input lag
reference_standard: temporal.refresh-rates
reference_id: display-refresh-rates

# Term: Color Gamut
id: color-gamut
term: Color Gamut
definition: The complete subset of colors that can be accurately represented in a given color space or by a specific display technology.
related_terms: color space, color depth, wide color gamut
reference_standard: color.gamuts
reference_id: display-color-gamuts

# Term: HDR (High Dynamic Range)
id: hdr
term: HDR (High Dynamic Range)
definition: A display technology that enables a wider range of luminance levels, producing greater contrast between light and dark areas of an image for a more realistic visual experience.
related_terms: SDR, contrast ratio, nits, local dimming
reference_standard: color
reference_id: hdr-standards

# Term: Pixel Density
id: pixel-density
term: Pixel Density
definition: The concentration of pixels on a display, typically measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or pixels per centimeter (PPCM). Higher pixel density results in sharper images with less visible pixelation.
related_terms: resolution, retina display, 4K, 8K
reference_standard: resolutions
reference_id: pixel-density-metrics
